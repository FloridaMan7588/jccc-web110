            <h2>Shawnee Mission Northwest Choir Program</h2>
            <h3>About the Program</h3>
            <p>The Shawnee Mission Northwest Choir department and Fine Arts programs are the pride and joy of the
                Northwest Cougars. Multiple times a year, the Ensembles perform choral and modern works for audiences
                from local area parents to crowds at concert halls. Directed by Mrs. Cassie Banion and accompanied by
                Mrs. Nancy Hulett, the choirs are lead with excellence in mind, and you can often find their performers
                competing in State Choral Competitions and performing in High Level Honor Choirs. Often performing in
                the Greg Parker Auditorium, the ensembles each sing multiple songs with many origins, from foreign
                language pieces to traditional and folk songs, each unique in their performance.</p>

<!--I may be biased because this is my school, but I do quite like choir so I'm glad I could write about it as an activity. Thanks for this wonderful class, I've quite enjoyed it!-->
